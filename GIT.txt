how to resolve merge conflict in git ?
A merge conflict happens when two branches have changes in the same part of a file, and Git doesn’t know which one to keep.
there will be 3 opions 1. accept current changes 2 . accept incoming changes 3. accept both changes
or 
# Check conflicts
git status

# Open & edit files to resolve conflicts
# Remove conflict markers <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>

# Add resolved files
git add <file>

# Complete the merge
git commit

what is merge and rebase ?
git merge takes the changes from one branch and combines them into another branch.
   //It creates a new merge commit, which keeps the full branch history with all diverging paths.
git rebase moves your commits on top of another branch, 
   //rewriting the commit history to look like you built your changes directly off the latest branch.
>>When to use merge
✅ To combine finished feature branches into main or develop.
✅ To preserve full history of how changes evolved.
✅ When teamwork needs an audit trail of who branched when.
✅ Safe for shared branches — no rewrite.
>>When to use rebase
✅ To keep history linear & clean — so git log is easier to read.
✅ To update your feature branch with the latest main before merging:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout feature
git pull --rebase origin main
✅ When working solo on your branch — rebase before opening a PR.
⚠️ Don’t rebase shared branches (you’ll rewrite other people’s commits).
